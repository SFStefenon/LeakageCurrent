# Time Series of Leakage Current in Contaminated Insulators

To simulate salt contamination that accumulates over time on the surface of the insulators, six insulators were mounted in a saline chamber. A 8.66 kV RMS 60Hz was applied to the insulators (same phase) and the salt concentration was increased gradually. This voltage level is defined by the NBR 10621 (similar to IEC 60507), standard used by the electrical power utility, specifically this standard deals with the determination of the characteristics of supportability under artificial pollution for insulators in electric power grids for the 15 kV class.

To monitor and record the applied voltage and resulting leakage current, an interface was developed in LabVIEW software. Each of the insulators was individually connected to the ground to measure the leakage current through a shunt resistor. From the six analyzed insulators, two did not have flashed over and the respective leakage current values were measured until the end of the experiment. The other insulators were monitored only until the surface breakdown occurred. 

The experiment was carried out by **Nemesio Fava Sopelsa Neto** under the supervision of Dr. **Luiz Henrique Meyer**, in the High Voltage Laboratory of the Regional University of Blumenau (FURB), Brazil. The data were organized in this repository by Dr. **Stefano Frizzo Stefenon**.
